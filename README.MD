# 🧱 Simplified Blockchain with Akka (Scala)

This project implements a **simplified blockchain system** using Scala and Akka actors. It demonstrates the core components of a blockchain in a minimal, educational setup:

- **Block**: Represents a single block in the chain.
- **Blockchain**: Manages the chain of blocks and validates additions.
- **Broker**: Manages the transactions and communicates with BlockChain to mine block
- **Miner**: Handles proof and validation of block, mines new blocks.
- **Node**: Exposes REST API to public.

### Components

- **Block**  
  Holds data such as index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, and a proof (e.g., for proof-of-work).

- **Blockchain**  
  A list of blocks. Validates new blocks and maintains immutability.

- **Miner**  
  Gathers pending transactions, performs mining (proof-of-work), and creates new blocks.

- **Node**  
  The gateway for external requests. Sends transactions to the miner and retrieves data from the blockchain.

### 🕸️ Simulating a Distributed Network

To simulate a multi-node blockchain network (distributed behavior), you can instantiate **N groups** of the following 4 actors:

Each node consists of:

- `NodeX` — REST API interface
- `BrokerX` — Handles transactions
- `MinerX` — Mines and validates blocks
- `BlockchainX` — Maintains the chain

#### Example: 2 Nodes

```
NodeA Group:
  - NodeA
  - BrokerA
  - MinerA
  - BlockchainA

NodeB Group:
  - NodeB
  - BrokerB
  - MinerB
  - BlockchainB

```

Each **Node** can:

- 🧩 Maintain its own **independent blockchain**
- 🪙 **Mine** new blocks with its own transactions
- 📥 **Receive** transactions via REST
- 📡 **Broadcast** newly mined blocks to **other nodes**
