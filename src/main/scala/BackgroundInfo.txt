Mining the Block:
When a node mines a block, it performs the mining process (finding the correct proof of work, for example) and creates
a new block with the transactions that are pending in that node. The node then broadcasts the new block to other
nodes in the network.

Displaying the Block to Other Nodes:
When a node successfully mines a block, it will broadcast the block to all other nodes in the network. This is typically
done through a gossip protocol, where each node sends the block to its peers, and the peers send it to their peers,
eventually spreading the block throughout the network.

Other nodes that receive the new block will:
Verify the block (check the proof, check that transactions are valid, ensure the block follows the chain rules, etc.).
Add the block to their local copy of the blockchain. If the block is valid, they will also update their pending
transaction pool by removing the transactions that are included in the block.
